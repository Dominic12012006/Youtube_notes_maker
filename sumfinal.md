**Code Example: Simulating Kingpin's Strength**

```python
# Simulating Kingpin's strength
muscle_mass = 95  # percentage of body weight as muscle mass
body_weight = 250  # kg
dumbbell_weight = 300  # kg

if muscle_mass > 90:
    print("Kingpin can lift the dumbbell with ease!")
else:
    print("Kingpin struggles to lift the dumbbell.")
```
